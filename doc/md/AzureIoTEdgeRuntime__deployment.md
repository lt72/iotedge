# Azure IoT Edge Deployment

![Architecture](./images/AzureIoTEdgeRuntime__architecture__depl_diag.png)

The IoT Edge Runtime manages high-value services running on devices and enables communication between them. It allows workflows running on devices to be configured, deployed and monitored from the cloud, securely and at scale. 

<TODO: add further test to illustrate the architecture diagram and how components are deployed>
